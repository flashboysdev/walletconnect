# About

This is a different approach to [WalletConnects](https://walletconnect.org/) idea of connecting web-based distributed applications with mobile crypto wallets.

``` 
NOTE

This is still work in progress and first implementation of the idea.

```

Main focus was to try different implementation for connecting dapps with mobile wallets. 

This repository consists of two parts:

1. [bridge-socket-server](https://github.com/flashboysdev/walletconnect/tree/master/walletconnect/bridge-socket-server) 

    A simple [socket.io](https://socket.io) used for communication between dapps and mobile wallets.

2. [browser-connect-boilerplate](https://github.com/flashboysdev/walletconnect/tree/master/walletconnect/browser-connect-boilerplate) 

    "Boilerplate" that contains functions which can me implemented in dapp for basic communication. 
    
    ***Work in progress***

3. react-native-mobile-app ***TODO***
